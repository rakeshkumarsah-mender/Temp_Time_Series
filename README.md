**# Temp_Time_Series
Problem Statement:**
To analyse IoT Temperature sensor data in to find the hidden patterns, insights & predict the Heat Risk index on human body

**Description:**
IIoT is covering major enterprise monitoring system. These IIoT devices produce heat. One major index (Heat Index) is recorded for IOT device. 
The idea is to analyze the Heat Index from IOT devices and predict the risk.
Reading from a room fitted with IOT device is taken over a period. This data (time series data) is then analyzed for patterns and variance in the room temperature and insights are derived from the data.

**Solution:**
Patterns in the Internal and External temperate are analyzed to see how internal and external temperature is related. Next scenario is predicted, and Risk is estimated.
